did the traiing with 200 images 

sample rate 30 to capture from video.


did visual inspection:

result:

when trained with middle camera angle and road is wide ( no bend) this traiined model gives good result than pretrainned model.

find some problem 
whne bend or camera angle difference(different location or my car overtaking a a vehicle)
it seems model not capture well.

protential solution:

increase framerate on such instance may increase accuracy.

camera move to different location and capture images.

(this annotattion and preprocessing taking considerable time and effort>>
may be descope to these camera angles or may be finetune the model with more data with high framerate
in such occations.)
